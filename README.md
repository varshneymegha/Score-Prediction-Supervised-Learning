Simple Linear Regression Model Building

The task is to predict the percentage of a student based on the no. of study hours.

Since, there are only two variables:
* Dependent Variable: Score
* Independent Variable: Hours spent on studying This model building is called as Simple Linear Regression.


This walk-flow contains the following steps:
* Library Handling
* Loading & Analysing data
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Data Preparation for Model building
* Building the Linear Model
* Prediction on Test Data Sets
